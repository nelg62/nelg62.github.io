# My First Blog Post

Published on: 11/12/2024

This is a tutorial by Radu Mariescu-Istodor explailing how to create a christmas calander using only javascript each day explaining new ways of creating reusable components and code

<!-- ## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come. -->
